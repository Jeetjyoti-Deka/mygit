# MyGit

A minimal Git-like version control system implemented in **Go**, created as a learning project to understand how Git works under the hood.

## ðŸš€ Features Implemented

- `mygit init` â€“ Initializes a new repository
- `mygit add <file>` â€“ Stages file(s) for commit
- `mygit commit -m "<message>"` â€“ Commits staged changes
- `mygit log` â€“ Shows commit history
- `mygit status` â€“ Displays staged, modified, and untracked files

> âœ… All content is stored in a `.mygit` folder (like `.git`), including object files, index, and commit metadata.
